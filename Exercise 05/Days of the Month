#Exercise 5: Days of the Month
#Denise Marielle Menguita
'''
Write a program that tells a user how many days there are in a specific month.
Use a dictionary to map the month numbers (1-12) to the number of days in
each month.

Instructions:
1. Create a Dictionary: Define a dictionary where the keys are month numbers and the values are the number of days in those months.
2. Input Handling: Ask the user to input the month number.
3. Check and Output: Use an if-else statement to check if the input is valid and print the number of days in the corresponding month.

Advanced Requirement:
Leap Year Adjustment: Modify the program to account for leap years.
For February, ask the user if the year is a leap year and adjust the number of days accordingly.
