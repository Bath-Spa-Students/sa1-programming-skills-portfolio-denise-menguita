#Exercise 6 - Brute Force Attack
#Denise Marielle Menguita
'''
Write a program that simulates a password entry system. The correct password is defined as 12345. The program should keep asking the user to enter the password until they provide the correct one.

Basic Requirements:
Define the correct password.
Use a while loop to repeatedly ask the user for the password until the correct one is entered.
Output an appropriate message when the correct password is entered.
Optional Requirements:
Modify the program to include a maximum of 5 password attempts.
If the user enters the wrong password, inform them of the remaining attempts.
If the maximum number of attempts is reached, inform the user that the authorities have been alerted.

#define the correct password
password = "12345"

#variable
attempts = 5

while attempts > 0:
    pass_user = input("Enter the password: ") #get input from user

    if pass_user == password: #correct input = access granted
        print("Access granted!")
        break
    
    else:
        attempts -= 1 #incorrect input = -1 attempt
        if attempts > 0:
            print(f"Access denied. You have {attempts} attempts left.")
        else:
            print("Access denied. No attempts left.",
                    "Authorities have been alerted.")
