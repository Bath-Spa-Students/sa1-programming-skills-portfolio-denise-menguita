#Denise Marielle Menguita
'''
Use your newly acquired knowledge of the for loop to complete the following
tasks. Print all values to the console in each case. You may include all loops in a single project.
1) Write a loop that counts up from 0 to 50 in increments of 1.
2) Write a loop that counts down from 50 to 0 in decrements of 1.
3) Write a loop that counts up from 30 to 50 in increments of 1.
4) Write a loop that counts down from 50 to 10 in decrements of 2.
5) Write a loop that counts up from 100 to 200 in increments of 5.
