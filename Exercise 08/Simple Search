#Exercise 8 - Simple Search
#Denise Marielle Menguita
#--------------------------------
'''
Write a program that searches for a specific string within a list of strings.
The list is initialized with specific names ("Jake" "Zac", "Ian", "Ron", "Sam", "Dave"). , and your task is to search for "Sam".

Optional Requirements:
Allow the user to input the search term instead of using a predefined value.
Implement the search functionality based on user input.
'''

names = ["Jake", "Zac", "Ian", "Ron", "Sam", "Dave"] #list of names

search_name = input(("Enter name: ")) #get input

if search_name in names: #search for the name
    print(search_name, "found in the list.")
else:
    print(search_name, "not found in the list.")
